# ECSE324

Here are the assignments that I completed for the course ECSE324 Computer Organization.
The assignments are written in ARM assembly, with the help of [this simulator](http://ecse324.ece.mcgill.ca/simulator/?sys=arm-de1soc). They can be directly copied to the simulator and be compiled overthere.
