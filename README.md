# ECSE324

Here are the assignments that I completed for the course ECSE324 Computer Organization.
The assignments are written in ARM assembly.
Due to the The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the assignments fore this course were written with the help of [this simulator](http://ecse324.ece.mcgill.ca/simulator/?sys=arm-de1soc) instead of a regular Altera DE1-SoC single board computer. 
The assignments can be directly copied to the simulator and be compiled over there.
